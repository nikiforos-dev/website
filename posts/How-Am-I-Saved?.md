author_bio: "Father Spyridon is an Orthodox priest serving in ROCOR in England and\
    \ a prolific author of many spiritual books. Orthodoxy And The Kingdom of Satan\
    \ has drawn most attention because of its exploration into the ways in which Satan\
    \ is working to construct a One World Government through the institutions we see\
    \ in today\u2019s world. It explains how many trends in modern culture, including\
    \ Hollywood, ecumensim and the arms trade are being exploited to enslave us. Fr\
    \ Spyridon spoke out about the sexual deviance in Hollywood long before the Harvey\
    \ Weinstein case hit the media.\nFr Spyridon\u2019s most recent book, The UFO\
    \ Deception, explores the UFO phenomenon and identifies how movies, technology\
    \ and philosophy have been used to guide public perception of what is happening.\
    \ But as a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church, he demonstrates a much longer\
    \ history that lies behind it, and how a terrible deception is at work."
